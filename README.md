# JC2MP-Voice-Chat
Proximity voice chat for Just Cause 2 Multiplayer

## Setting Up

You'll probably want to modify the website to go to in `client/cVoice.lua` since you won't be able to connect if you're not on the Panau Survival server.

Once you've done that, check out the readme in `website` for more instructions.
