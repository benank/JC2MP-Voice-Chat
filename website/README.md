# JC2MP-Voice-Chat

This is a script for Just Cause 2 Multiplayer Mod that enables proximity voice chat. It comes in two parts: the JC2MP script and the website.

Players will get a code ingame that they can enter on the website to connect. Once connected on the website, they will be able to talk to other nearby players.
